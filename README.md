# Promotion Response Predictive Modeling

## Introduction
This project aims to predict customer responses to promotional activities in the retail sector. By accurately anticipating which customers are likely to respond positively to promotions, businesses can deliver personalized experiences, build customer loyalty, and enhance sales and market position. The analysis is based on a dataset containing 20,000 instances and 17 features sourced from Kaggle, reflecting customersâ€™ past interactions with various promotions and transactions.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files:

1. Prediction Python Code: The Python scripts used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
2. Data File: The dataset used for the analysis, which includes customer interactions with promotions and transactions.
3. Technical Report: A detailed technical report outlining the methodology, experimental setup, results, and future directions of the project.
4. Predictive Results: The final predictive results generated by the model.

## File Descriptions
1. Prediction Python Code: The Python code is organized into scripts that cover various stages of the predictive modeling process:
2. data_preprocessing.py: Script for cleaning and preparing the data.
3. feature_engineering.py: Script for engineering features from the raw data.
4. model_training.py: Script for training the predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm.
4. model_evaluation.py: Script for evaluating the model's performance.
